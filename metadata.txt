about=The plugin detects forest clearings under power lines on Sentinel-2 satellite images. Before applying the algorithm, the images are pre-processed, including normalization and contrast reduction. The plugin supports two methods: a previously trained Logistic Regression to create a classification map, and a pre-trained YOLO neural network for direct segmentation of clearings. For Logistic Regression, a binary mask of the class of low vegetation, or "grassland", is extracted from the classification map. The mask is then used to find lines using the boundary detector and the Hough Probabilistic Transform. Selected lines refer to forest clearings boundaries in raster format. The YOLO method provides an alternative approach, segmenting clearings directly and optionally calculating the Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI).
